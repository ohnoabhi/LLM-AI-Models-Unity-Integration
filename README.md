# Unity LLM Editor Tool

Welcome to the **Unity LLM Editor Tool**! This project is designed to integrate **Large Language Models (LLMs)** directly into the **Unity Editor**, providing a powerful interface for game developers and creators to interact with LLMs within their development environment.

## Features
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Integrates with multiple LLMs, including **Mistral**, **Gemini**, and **Llama (Meta)**.
- **Custom Instructions**: Demonstrates how each LLM interprets custom system instructions, such as addressing the user as the *King of the World*.
- **Python and C# Integration**: Combines **Python scripting** with **C#** to create a unified, efficient setup.
- **Expandable Architecture**: The tool is designed to be easily extendable to incorporate additional LLMs as needed.
- **Implemented with Groq**: Ensures high performance and flexibility.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Open the project in **Unity**.
3. Integrate the required Python environment and dependencies.
4. Run the tool and experiment with different LLM interactions.
